Decision Tree Algorithm written on C Language<br/>
    Program calculates the probability of apple color which you have its coordinates.<br/>
    First things first, algorithm needs to be taught. Algorithm taughts itself with data file(data.txt).<br/>
    After this stage, algorithm is ready to calculate.<br/>
    Enter the X and Y coordinates of the apple which you want to find its color.
